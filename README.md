# Generate a Password

## Description

This project served as a fundamental learning experience for me in JavaScript. I grasped key concepts like console.log(), variables, conditionals, and arrays, forming the foundation of my programming skills. I successfully implemented this knowledge to create a password generator, utilizing user prompts in the browser. Additionally, I delved into more advanced topics including Math.floor, Math.random, event listeners, and for loops. This project not only showcased my understanding of JavaScript basics but also enhanced my skills in handling more complex functionalities. I'm excited to continue exploring and learning in the field of JavaScript.
