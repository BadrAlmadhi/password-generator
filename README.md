# Generate a Password

```
In this project, this assignment was aksing me to make a
 password generator. This project is my first JavaScript
 project with the Georgia Tech Coding BootCamp. It was one
 of the most challenging tasks that gave me the opportunity
 to know about new methods such as .math, .random, prompt,
 parseInt, and alert.

This project helped me to understand those methods and helped
me gain all the knowledge about them. Also, I understand more
about the if statemnt, functions, and for loop. I am so glad
I have done this project to help me understand JavaScript.

THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
